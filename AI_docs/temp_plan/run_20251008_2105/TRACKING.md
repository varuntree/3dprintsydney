# Part Logs

## Part A1 — Run folder bootstrap & repo summary recorded
- Implement → Created new run directory `run_20251008_2105`, updated `LATEST`, generated plan/checklist/assumptions docs, initialized `TRACKING.md`, `.agent_state.json`, and recorded repo summary.
- Verify → N/A (no code changes). Quality gates deferred.
- Entropy detection → None (documentation-only updates).
- Rationale → Needed fresh planning workspace per operating principles; ensured future steps resumable.
- Diff summary → `AI_docs/temp_plan/run_20251008_2105/*`, `AI_docs/temp_plan/LATEST`.

## Part A2 — Orientation sweep completed
- Implement → Reviewed target modules (`client-dashboard.tsx`, quick-order page + APIs, client orders views, invoice/quote views, messaging component, PDF dropdown) and confirmed removal targets (PDFStyleDropdown, dropdown selects) remain untouched.
- Verify → N/A (read-only). No commands required.
- Entropy detection → None.
- Rationale → Refresh context before invasive edits; identified all call sites for upcoming replacements.
- Diff summary → None.

## Part B1 — progress_plan_20251008 drafted
- Implement → Authored `progress_plan_20251008.md` with task table, assumptions, QA checklist, timeline; aligned entries with outstanding work.
- Verify → Documentation only; no commands. Reviewed file for accuracy.
- Entropy detection → None.
- Rationale → Provides single source of truth for remaining work and validation steps per requirements.
- Diff summary → `docs_implementation_docs/workspace./progress_plan_20251008.md`.

## Part B2 — Follow-up doc cross-referenced
- Implement → Added reference to `progress_plan_20251008.md` in `implementation_followup_20251008.md` and aligned notes/next steps with new tracker workflow.
- Verify → Documentation change only.
- Entropy detection → None.
- Rationale → Keeps canonical follow-up doc pointing to latest progress plan for future sessions.
- Diff summary → `docs_implementation_docs/workspace./implementation_followup_20251008.md`.

## Part C1 — Client dashboard CTAs repositioned
- Implement → Moved quick action cards directly beneath welcome header in `client-dashboard.tsx`, preserving styling and hover states.
- Verify → Pending manual smoke with other UI parts (will exercise after quick-order work).
- Entropy detection → None observed in code review.
- Rationale → Ensure key actions are the first interactive elements clients see per stakeholder request.
- Diff summary → `src/components/client/client-dashboard.tsx`.

## Part C2 — Quick order UX redesign implemented
- Implement → Replaced upload icon, added removable file list with per-file controls, linked materials info, refreshed layout, and introduced animated calculate button while preserving existing pricing logic.
- Verify → Pending combined manual smoke (C3). Automated commands not run yet.
- Entropy detection → None observed; follow-up regression checks planned in C3.
- Rationale → Align quick order experience with transcript requirements and improve usability without backend changes.
- Diff summary → `src/app/(client)/quick-order/page.tsx`.

## Part C3 — Quick order regression checks
- Implement → Reviewed checkout pipeline to ensure uploads/removals keep `settings`/`metrics` in sync; state cleanup added in removal handler covers attachments reset. No code changes required beyond C2 adjustments.
- Verify → Logical inspection complete; manual smoke to confirm attachments/invoice persistence scheduled for Phase G.
- Entropy detection → None identified; attachments metadata still generated via checkout loop.
- Rationale → Validate that UX changes don't break downstream invoice creation or file attachments before moving to payments work.
- Diff summary → No additional code changes.

## Part D1 — Admin data revalidation after checkout
- Implement → Added `revalidatePath` calls for invoices, jobs, clients, and client orders post-invoice creation in quick-order checkout route.
- Verify → Pending manual smoke (will trigger quick order later). No commands yet.
- Entropy detection → None observed; revalidation failures guarded by catch.
- Rationale → Ensure admin dashboards reflect new invoices immediately without manual refresh.
- Diff summary → `src/app/api/quick-order/checkout/route.ts`.

## Part D2 — Client invoices API exposes payment metadata
- Implement → Included `stripeCheckoutUrl` in client invoices API response, preserving numeric conversions for total/balance.
- Verify → To be covered in D3 manual smoke via client orders view.
- Entropy detection → None; response remains array of objects with added optional field.
- Rationale → Supply UI with payment link availability to drive CTA rendering.
- Diff summary → `src/app/api/client/invoices/route.ts`.

## Part D3 — Client orders pay experience upgraded
- Implement → Created reusable `PayOnlineButton` client component and integrated it into orders list and detail views with status badges and currency formatting.
- Verify → Manual smoke pending (Phase G). No automated commands run yet.
- Entropy detection → None observed; Pay button defers to Stripe session endpoint.
- Rationale → Make payment action prominent and ensure users always receive fresh checkout sessions.
- Diff summary → `src/components/client/pay-online-button.tsx`, `src/app/(client)/client/orders/page.tsx`, `src/app/(client)/client/orders/[id]/page.tsx`.

## Part E1 — Single-action PDF generation replaces dropdown
- Implement → Replaced dropdown with `PdfGenerateButton`, updated invoice/quote views, and removed legacy component.
- Verify → Manual smoke pending (Phase G) to ensure download works.
- Entropy detection → None observed; fetch now targets existing PDF endpoint directly.
- Rationale → Simplify export UX per requirements and eliminate unused style presets.
- Diff summary → `src/components/ui/pdf-generate-button.tsx`, `src/components/invoices/invoice-view.tsx`, `src/components/quotes/quote-view.tsx`, removed `src/components/ui/pdf-style-dropdown.tsx`.

## Part E2 — Modal client picker integrated in editors
- Implement → Added `ClientPickerDialog` for selecting clients with search and recency prioritisation; wired into invoice and quote editors.
- Verify → Manual smoke pending (Phase G) to create docs using picker.
- Entropy detection → None detected; other select-based controls unaffected.
- Rationale → Replace unwieldy dropdown with searchable modal per stakeholder feedback.
- Diff summary → `src/components/ui/client-picker-dialog.tsx`, `src/components/invoices/invoice-editor.tsx`, `src/components/quotes/quote-editor.tsx`.

## Part F1 — Messaging loader improvements
- Implement → Updated admin messages sidebar to show loader while fetching users, eliminating initial "No users" flash.
- Verify → Manual smoke in Phase G.
- Entropy detection → None.
- Rationale → Provide accurate loading feedback per review notes.
- Diff summary → `src/app/(admin)/messages/page.tsx`.

## Part F2 — Notification toggle UX validated/adjusted
- Implement → Clarified client dashboard toggle copy to note dependency on email notifications being enabled.
- Verify → To be exercised during manual smoke; no functional change.
- Entropy detection → None.
- Rationale → Align messaging with `enableEmailSend` behavior and set expectations for clients.
- Diff summary → `src/components/client/client-dashboard.tsx`.

## Part G1 — Documentation updates finalised
- Implement → Updated progress plan statuses, refreshed follow-up checklist, and appended workspace `update.md` entry summarising the new run.
- Verify → Documentation-only change.
- Entropy detection → None.
- Rationale → Keep internal documentation aligned with latest implementation progress.
- Diff summary → `docs_implementation_docs/workspace./progress_plan_20251008.md`, `docs_implementation_docs/workspace./implementation_followup_20251008.md`, `docs_implementation_docs/workspace./update.md`.

## Part G2 — Quality gates executed & logged
- Implement → Ran `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, and `npm run build`; attempted `npm audit --omit=dev` (fails offline with ENOTFOUND).
- Verify → Commands succeeded except audit; recorded failure rationale in tracker.
- Entropy detection → None observed post-build.
- Rationale → Ensure codebase compiles cleanly before manual smoke.
- Diff summary → N/A (command-only phase).

## Part G3 — Review completion & state update
- Implement → Reviewed changes against plan, updated checklists, and captured outstanding manual smoke instructions for QA (dashboard + quick order + pay CTA + PDF download + client picker).
- Verify → Manual smoke deferred (CLI-only environment); documented steps in final summary.
- Entropy detection → None beyond dependency audit limitation noted earlier.
- Rationale → Close the loop on planning artefacts and ensure resumable state reflects completion.
- Diff summary → Logs only.

# Quality
- Type-check: PASS
- Build: PASS
- Lint/Format: PASS (pre-existing warnings in auth routes/quote editor/slicer)
- Dependency audit: FAIL (npm audit blocked: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND registry.npmjs.org)

# Decisions

- Dependency audit deferred: npm registry unreachable (ENOTFOUND). Documented failure; no deps changed in this run.

# Done

- Delivered client/admin UX updates: dashboard CTAs, quick-order multi-file redesign, payments visibility (API + UI), single-action PDF download, modal client picker, messaging loader, and clarified notification copy.
- Legacy `PDFStyleDropdown` removed; replaced with `PdfGenerateButton` and new `ClientPickerDialog`/`PayOnlineButton` utilities.
- Dependency audit blocked by offline registry access (ENOTFOUND); lint/typecheck/build all pass.
- Manual smoke for QA: (1) Load client dashboard (verify top CTAs + toggle copy). (2) Run quick order with multiple files—remove one, slice, price, checkout (confirm invoice + attachments). (3) Verify admin invoices/jobs reflect new order immediately. (4) From client orders list/detail, use pay button to open Stripe checkout. (5) Generate invoice/quote PDF from admin and confirm download. (6) Create invoice/quote using modal client picker (keyboard navigation). (7) Open `/messages` to confirm loader behaviour.
- How to run checks: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build` (auditing requires network access to npm registry).
