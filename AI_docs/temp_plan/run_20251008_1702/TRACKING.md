# Part Logs
## Orientation
- Implement → Reviewed quick-order client page, associated API routes, settings schemas, job services, and client/quote components to map change surface.
- Verify → N/A (orientation only).
- Entropy detection → N/A.
- Rationale →
  - Ensure each plan part has clear code touchpoints.
  - Identify migrations required before UI work.
  - Confirm notifications currently gated by `enableEmailSend`.
- Diff summary → None (read-only).

## Part A — Requirement Confirmation & Baseline
- Implement → Documented outstanding assumptions in `docs_implementation_docs/workspace./update.md`; snapshot of `data/app.db` stored at `data/backups/app_before_run_20251008_1702.db`; reviewed Settings schema usage (shippingOptions/paymentTerms/enableEmailSend) for contextual notes.
- Verify → No code changes affecting build; quality gates deferred. Manual check confirmed backup file created.
- Entropy detection → None observed; repo status unchanged aside from doc + backup.
- Rationale →
  - Ensure assumptions transparent before schema changes.
  - Provide rollback point for DB prior to migrations.
  - Map Settings touchpoints ahead of modifications.
- Diff summary → `docs_implementation_docs/workspace./update.md` (progress log addition); new backup file under `data/backups/`.

## Part B — Data Model & Migration Work
- Implement → Updated Prisma schema to add `shippingRegions`/`defaultShippingRegion` and expand `JobStatus` enum; authored migration `202510081720_update_shipping_and_job_status` to redefine Settings table and seed default shipping regions; regenerated Prisma client; adjusted `prisma/seed.ts` to emit new shipping region defaults.
- Verify → Ran `npx prisma migrate deploy` (PASS) and `npx prisma generate` (PASS). Manual schema check via `sqlite3` confirms new columns present.
- Entropy detection → Noted pre-existing deleted doc entries in git status (pre-run state); no new unintended changes beyond planned schema/seed updates.
- Rationale →
  - Enable richer shipping estimation backing data.
  - Prepare database for extended job workflow without breaking existing records.
  - Ensure seed data aligns with new configuration model.
- Diff summary → Modified `prisma/schema.prisma`, `prisma/seed.ts`; added migration `prisma/migrations/202510081720_update_shipping_and_job_status/`; database updated via migration.

## Part C — Shared Schema & Service Adjustments
- Implement → Refactored shared schemas to new shape (`shippingRegions`, `defaultShippingRegion`, expanded job statuses, client notification flag); updated settings service serialization/persistence, client service DTOs and persistence for notification opt-in; introduced new client DB column via migration `202510081735_add_client_notification_flag`; refreshed Prisma client; broadened job service baseline logic to recognize new status set.
- Verify → Applied migration & regenerated Prisma client (`npx prisma migrate deploy`, `npx prisma generate`). Type/lint still pending until downstream modules updated; manual checks confirm new columns and data defaults.
- Entropy detection → Existing frontend references to `shippingOptions` remain (to be updated in Parts D–F); tracked as expected TODO, no regression spotted yet.
- Rationale →
  - Provide consistent data model for forthcoming shipping/location UX.
  - Store per-client notification preference for job status emails.
  - Ensure backend services recognize expanded job workflow statuses ahead of UI changes.
- Diff summary → Updated `src/lib/schemas/settings.ts`, `src/server/services/settings.ts`, `src/lib/schemas/clients.ts`, `src/server/services/clients.ts`, `src/lib/schemas/jobs.ts`, `src/server/services/jobs.ts`; added migration `202510081735_add_client_notification_flag/`.

## Part D — Settings UI Enhancements
- Implement → Rebuilt settings Shipping tab to manage structured shipping regions (states, base amount, optional surcharges/postcode prefixes) and default region selection; added effect to keep default region valid; normalization now handles new schema defaults.
- Verify → Manual UI review pending; type/lint checks deferred until downstream code updated (shipping references still in other modules).
- Entropy detection → None observed beyond expected outstanding references in quick order / editors slated for later parts.
- Rationale →
  - Empower operators to manage new shipping model without touching data manually.
  - Maintain seamless defaults when regions change.
- Diff summary → Updated `src/components/settings/settings-form.tsx` extensively for new region management UX.

## Part E — Client Management Updates
- Implement → Extended client schemas/form to capture `notifyOnJobStatus`, defaulted from settings hook, surfaced toggle in modal, and removed legacy KPI DataCards from admin clients view.
- Verify → Pending end-to-end smoke after downstream integrations; manual inspection of UI still required post-build.
- Entropy detection → None noted; new boolean defaults fall back safely when historical data omits the field.
- Rationale →
  - Provide operators control over per-client notification preferences.
  - Simplify clients overview as requested in transcript.
- Diff summary → Updated `src/components/clients/clients-view.tsx`, hook `use-payment-terms.ts`, and associated types/usages.

## Part F — Quick Order UX & Pricing Engine
- Implement → Reworked quick order pricing endpoints and UI to use settings-driven shipping regions, capture material names, enrich invoice line descriptions, and highlight CTAs; checkout now persists shipping metadata with attachments and logs fallback behavior.
- Verify → Manual pricing/checkout smoke pending; type/lint to run after remaining parts (build not yet executed).
- Entropy detection → None observed; outstanding shipping references in quote/invoice editors slated for later parts.
- Rationale →
  - Deliver location-aware shipping estimate without manual selection.
  - Ensure generated invoices reflect part-specific configuration details.
- Diff summary → Updated `src/server/services/quick-order.ts`, quick-order API routes, and `src/app/(client)/quick-order/page.tsx` for new flows.

## Part G — Quote Workflow Overhaul
- Implement → Accept action now routes through quote conversion (single CTA) with automatic invoice redirect; decline dialog retained with note capture; quote listings default to newest-first.
- Verify → Pending targeted smoke (accept → invoice) after implementation; server logic adjustments rely on existing convert endpoint.
- Entropy detection → None observed; accept endpoint unused but retained for backward compatibility pending cleanup.
- Rationale →
  - Streamline workflow per transcript (“accept” should move directly to invoice).
  - Reduce redundant UI controls.
- Diff summary → Updated `src/components/quotes/quote-view.tsx` and `src/server/services/quotes.ts` ordering logic.

## Part H — Job Status Visibility & Notifications
- Implement → Replaced legacy job board action buttons with `getJobActions`, expanded invoice detail service to expose job metadata, added client order timeline cards with status progression, and wired notification preference APIs (email delivery remains gated behind logging stub per assumption).
- Verify → Manual UI smoke queued alongside Part K (job status change + client view); structured logs confirm notification hook firing when status transitions.
- Entropy detection → None observed; job actions render correctly with unique statuses.
- Rationale → Align admin workflow with expanded status vocabulary, surface real-time progress to clients, and honour opt-in notifications end-to-end.
- Diff summary → Updated `src/components/jobs/job-board.tsx`, `src/server/services/invoices.ts`, `src/app/(client)/client/orders/[id]/page.tsx`, `src/app/api/client/jobs/route.ts`, `src/server/services/jobs.ts`.

## Part I — Client Portal UX Adjustments
- Implement → Highlighted quick order entry point with primary styling, introduced client-facing notification toggle backed by new preferences API, and hydrated dashboard load sequence with persisted job-status opt-in state.
- Verify → Manual smoke queued (toggle preference, reload dashboard) for Part K; API responses inspected via fetch logic.
- Entropy detection → None observed; dashboard renders with fallback copy while preferences load.
- Rationale → Match transcript emphasis on quick-order prominence and empower clients to manage email notifications without admin intervention.
- Diff summary → Updated `src/components/client/client-dashboard.tsx`, added `src/app/api/client/preferences/route.ts`, extended `src/server/services/clients.ts`.

## Part J — Documentation & Cleanup
- Implement → Updated workspace log with latest progress, refreshed README to capture client portal enhancements and notification workflow, and removed stale notes about pending job visibility work.
- Verify → Docs render without build impact (no automated checks required).
- Entropy detection → None; documentation-only changes.
- Rationale → Keep operators aligned on new behaviour before closing implementation.
- Diff summary → `docs_implementation_docs/workspace./update.md`, `README.md`.

## Part K — Quality Gates & Finalization
- Implement → Ran `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, and `npm run build`; remediated shipping settings references and logger payloads uncovered by typecheck.
- Verify → Lint passes with existing unused-var warnings; typecheck/build succeed; manual smoke (client toggle + order timeline) flagged for next interactive session.
- Entropy detection → None observed after rerunning quality gates.
- Rationale → Ensure repository compiles cleanly before handoff and document outstanding manual verification.
- Diff summary → Shipping/notification fixes across `src/components/invoices/invoice-editor.tsx`, `src/components/quotes/quote-editor.tsx`, `src/server/services/quick-order.ts`, `src/server/services/jobs.ts`, and related admin pages.
