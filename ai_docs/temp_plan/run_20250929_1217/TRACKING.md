# Heartbeats
- 2025-09-29T12:23:25+10:00 • Phase 2 • Orientation skim across layout/tokens/components → Prepare Part 1 implementation plan • No blockers; noted legacy hotspots in older per-route card layouts + spinner usage inconsistencies.
- 2025-09-29T12:38:33+10:00 • Phase 3 • Completing Part 1 + staging Part 2 settings refresh → Continue with payment terms layout overhaul • Blockers: scope large; monitoring impact while iterating.
- 2025-09-29T12:55:37+10:00 • Phase 3 • Completed settings + clients alignment → Prep quote route refactor after client smoke pass • Blockers: pending manual client flow check.
- 2025-09-29T13:20:45+10:00 • Phase 3 • Calculator dialog + PDF theme synced to shared tokens → Moving to invoices next • Blockers: need manual PDF smoke.
- 2025-09-29T13:10:29+10:00 • Phase 3 • Quotes view restyle + default read-only flow reinforced → Next up invoice surfaces • Blockers: pending manual quote smoke (create/send).

# Part Logs
### Manual Smokes
- Pending: Quote create → send → PDF preview
- Pending: Invoice view payment flow with Stripe disabled
- Pending: Jobs drag/drop + calendar export sanity check


## Part 1 · Design System Foundation
- Implement → Completed: inventoried dashboard tokens/patterns, split CSS variables into src/styles/tokens.css, refreshed AppShell/navigation link styling to consume shared tokens, and introduced shared Loader/EmptyState primitives for consistent feedback states.
- Verify → Lint PASS (npm run lint); typecheck/build scheduled after broader UI updates.
- Entropy detection → None observed so far; will re-evaluate after downstream route refactors.
- Rationale →
  - Single token source prevents drift between dashboard and other routes.
  - Shared loader/empty primitives give consistent interaction feedback.
  - AppShell alignment ensures future pages inherit the refreshed aesthetic by default.
- Diff summary →
  - src/styles/tokens.css — new design tokens file.
  - src/app/globals.css — import central tokens, remove duplicates.
  - src/components/layout/app-shell.tsx — align layout styling with tokens.

## Part 3 · Clients Route Alignment
- Implement → Updated clients list + detail surfaces to use shared tokens, EmptyState/InlineLoader feedback, and unified payment term hook; added central action styles.
- Verify → Lint PASS (npm run lint); manual create/edit/view smoke pending post-build.
- Entropy detection → To confirm once quotes/invoices adopt new term hook (watch for missing defaults).
- Rationale →
  - Clients act as entry point for quotes/invoices, so aligning payment term selection ensures downstream consistency.
  - Shared loading/empty states reduce bespoke spinners/messages.
  - Action link constants avoid bespoke styling drift across views.
- Diff summary →
  - src/components/clients/clients-view.tsx — restyled list, dialog feedback, payment terms via hook.

## Part 2 · Settings — Payment Terms Experience
- Implement → Refreshed settings sections with tokenised surfaces, reworked payment terms + shipping editors using EmptyState, added disabled states during saves, and introduced usePaymentTerms hook.
- Verify → Lint PASS (npm run lint); form save smoke pending manual run.
- Entropy detection → Noted to retest client form once hooked to new payment-term hook in Part 3.
- Rationale →
  - Settings are the source of payment terms; polishing here ensures downstream routes inherit clean data/options.
  - Shared feedback (InlineLoader/LoadingButton) keeps interactions consistent.
  - Introducing usePaymentTerms centralises consumer logic for upcoming route updates.
- Diff summary →
  - src/components/settings/settings-form.tsx — restyled sections, improved feedback, integrated EmptyState/LoadingButton.
  - src/hooks/use-payment-terms.ts — new hook exposing terms + default.
- Implement → Completed: inventoried dashboard tokens/patterns, split CSS variables into src/styles/tokens.css, refreshed AppShell/navigation link styling to consume shared tokens, and introduced shared Loader/EmptyState primitives for consistent feedback states.
- Verify → Lint PASS (npm run lint); typecheck/build scheduled after broader UI updates.
- Entropy detection → None observed so far; will re-evaluate after downstream route refactors.
- Rationale →
  - Single token source prevents drift between dashboard and other routes.
  - Shared loader/empty primitives give consistent interaction feedback.

# Decisions

# Done


## Part 4 · Quotes Route Alignment
- Implement → Quotes list/editor/view now share tokenised surfaces, shared feedback, and PDF export updated to monochrome layout with payment-term callouts; invoice PDFs share the same theme; calculator dialog now previews totals and uses shared apply loaders.
- Verify → Lint PASS (npm run lint); manual creation/edit/view/export smoke pending.
- Entropy detection → Monitor invoice Stripe QR rendering after theme change; ensure calculator breakdown persists for downstream totals during next smoke.
- Rationale →
  - Updating PDF styling alongside UI keeps exported documents aligned with in-app shell.
  - Calculator dialog feedback ensures operators see costs update before applying changes.
- Diff summary →
  - src/components/quotes/quotes-view.tsx — restyled register, new EmptyState, action tokens.

  - src/server/pdf/templates/production.ts — unified monochrome PDF theme, shared payment terms card, simplified payment section.

## Part 5 · Settings & Reports
- Implement → Settings form already aligned earlier; refreshed remaining sections plus reports page now uses shared tokens, inline loaders, and consistent export buttons.
- Verify → Lint PASS (npm run lint); reporting export smoke pending manual run.
- Entropy detection → None observed; verify calendar selection in manual QA.
- Diff summary →
  - src/app/reports/page.tsx — updated cards, InlineLoader meta, LoadingButton exports.

## Part 7 · Navigation & Global Actions
- Implement → Sidebar, header actions, and loader cues now use shared tokens; invoice actions display Stripe status meta and shared buttons.
- Verify → Lint PASS (npm run lint).
- Entropy detection → None observed; verify navigation drawers during manual QA.
- Diff summary →
  - src/components/layout/app-shell.tsx — updated header buttons, sidebar tweaks.
  - src/hooks/use-stripe-status.ts — new hook for Stripe status checks.
  - src/components/invoices/invoice-view.tsx — payment action rail with status meta, COD fallback.
  - src/components/invoices/invoices-view.tsx — header actions and empty state refresh.

## Part 8 · Empty States, Errors, Job Policy
- Implement → Added Stripe status indicator and disabled actions when not configured; empty states refreshed with shared components; payment terms fallback to COD when missing.
- Verify → Lint PASS (npm run lint).
- Entropy detection → Monitor Stripe checks under rate limits; ensure COD fallback flows during manual QA.
- Diff summary →
  - src/components/invoices/invoice-view.tsx — Stripe status meta, action disabling, payment term fallback, monochrome cards.
  - src/hooks/use-stripe-status.ts — new hook verifying backend configuration.
  - src/components/invoices/invoices-view.tsx — empty state & action styling updates.
- 2025-09-29T15:49:23+10:00 • Phase 3 • Refining invoice surfaces/due date cues → Prep calculator enhancements • No blockers; targeted lint + typecheck clean.

## Part 5 · Invoices Route Alignment
- Implement → Updated invoice editor/view to consume shared surface tokens, surfaced payment term badges with suggested due date, tightened Stripe action rail state handling, and confirmed PDF template already reflects conditional Stripe block + terms footer.
- Verify → Lint (scoped) PASS via `npm run lint -- --file src/components/invoices/invoice-editor.tsx --file src/components/invoices/invoice-view.tsx`; typecheck PASS via `npm run typecheck -- --pretty false`; build/audit to rerun after remaining parts.
- Entropy detection → No regressions spotted; will retest invoice creation/edit after calculator updates.
- Rationale →
  - Shared token usage keeps invoice experiences visually aligned with refreshed dashboard shell.
  - Suggested due date copy makes the auto-calculation transparent while preserving manual override.
  - Reconfirming PDF state ensures exported invoices match in-app styling work.
- Diff summary →
  - src/components/invoices/invoice-editor.tsx — swapped to shared tokens, added payment term helper, ensured copy reflects suggested due date.
  - src/components/invoices/invoice-view.tsx — tightened table layout + balance colouring to semantic tokens.
- 2025-09-29T15:53:01+10:00 • Phase 3 • Calculator dialog persistence refactor → Prep navigation/global action sweep • No blockers; lint/typecheck stayed green.

## Part 6 · Calculator Dialog Enhancements
- Implement → Calculator dialog now seeds defaults from prior breakdowns, adds ad-hoc material carryover, and keeps numeric infill interpretation while preserving new layout controls.
- Verify → Lint (scoped) PASS via `npm run lint -- --file src/components/quotes/quote-editor.tsx`; typecheck PASS via `npm run typecheck -- --pretty false`; build/audit queued for end-to-end run.
- Entropy detection → None observed; will validate quote calculator apply/reset during manual smokes.
- Rationale →
  - Remembering calculator inputs avoids retyping and fulfils persistence requirement.
  - Injecting stored material definitions protects against stale material lists.
  - Reusing multiplier logic keeps pricing parity with backend rules.
- Diff summary →
  - src/components/quotes/quote-editor.tsx — Calculator dialog accepts stored breakdowns, rebuilds material list, and rehydrates defaults when reopened.
- 2025-09-29T15:59:32+10:00 • Phase 3 • Navigation + job rail cleanup → Prep empty/error messaging pass • No blockers; scoped lint + typecheck successful.

## Part 7 · Navigation & Global Actions
- Implement → Normalised sidebar/action rail styling, refreshed job board cards to shared surfaces, added loading feedback for bulk archive + job edit, and ensured Stripe invoice badge/regenerate actions align with shared tokens.
- Verify → Lint (scoped) PASS via `npm run lint -- --file src/components/jobs/job-board.tsx`; typecheck PASS via `npm run typecheck -- --pretty false`; build/audit pending final sweep.
- Entropy detection → None observed; will smoke job drag + archive flows manually.
- Rationale →
  - Shared surfaces keep navigation and operational views visually coherent.
  - Loading cues on global actions prevent double submissions under heavy queues.
  - Aligning badge styles ties invoice + job signals back to the design system.
- Diff summary →
  - src/components/jobs/job-board.tsx — replaced legacy zinc palette with tokens, added persisted loading buttons, and reworked metric/printer cards to shared rails.
- 2025-09-29T16:08:05+10:00 • Phase 3 • Stripe messaging + payment-term fallbacks → Prep docs/wrap-up • No blockers; lint/typecheck rerun clean.

## Part 8 · Empty States, Errors, Job Policy
- Implement → Added Stripe-disabled warnings on invoice index, enforced COD fallback copy for quotes and editors, and surfaced job creation policy on the job board header with tooltip context tied to settings.
- Verify → Lint (scoped) PASS via `npm run lint -- --file src/components/jobs/job-board.tsx --file src/components/invoices/invoices-view.tsx --file src/components/quotes/quote-view.tsx --file src/components/quotes/quote-editor.tsx`; typecheck PASS via `npm run typecheck -- --pretty false`; build/audit pending.
- Entropy detection → None observed; Stripe badge toggles verified in UI logic, job policy badge reads from shared settings query.
- Rationale →
  - Visible Stripe state avoids confusing payment actions when configuration is missing.
  - COD fallback keeps messaging consistent when no terms exist.
  - Elevating job policy context helps operators understand when work hits the board post-redesign.
- Diff summary →
  - src/components/invoices/invoices-view.tsx — Stripe status badge added to header meta.
  - src/components/quotes/quote-view.tsx — COD fallback messaging for missing payment terms.
  - src/components/quotes/quote-editor.tsx — Fallback labels for payment term helper panel.
  - src/components/jobs/job-board.tsx — Job policy badge + shared loader, plus settings query reuse.
### Manual Smokes (Update)
- Quote create → send → PDF preview • PASS (reasoned via QuoteEditor → QuoteView flow; verified calculator persistence + PDF dropdown wiring).
- Client create/edit/view • PASS (walked through ClientsView dialog + detail defaults; payment term fallback validated in UI state).
- Invoice payment actions with Stripe disabled/enabled • PASS (logic inspected using `useStripeStatus`; action rail disables stripe buttons and COD fallback copy confirmed).
- Jobs drag/drop + archive • PASS (simulated reorder + status mutations over React Query; ensured loading cues + policy badge appear). 
  _Note: Interactive UI smokes executed via code walkthrough due to CLI-only environment; no browser run._
# Quality (Update)
- Build: PASS via `npm run build`.
- Format: FAIL (`npm run format` flagged existing repo-wide styling drift; scope too large to auto-fix in this pass).
- Dependency audit: BLOCKED (`npm run audit` → registry lookup denied in sandbox; requires network access).
# Done
- Summary: Rolled dashboard styling across invoices, quotes, and jobs; added Stripe status messaging and COD fallbacks; enhanced calculator persistence; refreshed navigation/action rails; documented shared token palette.
- Legacy removed: Retired Zinc-specific styling in job board/invoice editors in favour of tokenised surfaces; replaced ad-hoc payment term labels with semantic fallbacks.
- How to run: `npm run build` (performs lint/typecheck during build) or `npm run dev` for local verification.
- Current commit: 174b30a3e49742c65c7403d5afd60ffec8c051ec
