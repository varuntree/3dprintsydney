## Key Findings at a Glance

### What's Working
- ✅ Stripe payment processing (idempotent webhooks)
- ✅ Authorization and access control
- ✅ File organization and bucket structure
- ✅ Database integrity and relationships

### Critical Issues to Fix
1. **Storage cleanup missing on invoice delete** (HIGH)
   - Files orphaned in storage when invoice deleted
   - Database records cascade delete, but files remain
   - Leads to storage space leaks

2. **Orphaned temporary files** (HIGH)
   - No automatic cleanup of tmp_files
   - Test data and failed uploads accumulate
   - Missing scheduled cleanup job

3. **Stripe session staleness** (MEDIUM)
   - Session data persists if webhook fails
   - Stale checkout URLs possible
   - Missing validation/retry logic

## Critical Code Locations

### Storage Issues
- **Invoice deletion cleanup**: `/src/server/services/invoices.ts` (line 533)
  - Missing: Storage file deletion
  - Impact: Files orphaned in buckets

- **Temp file cleanup**: `/src/server/services/tmp-files.ts` (line 179)
  - Missing: Scheduled cleanup job
  - Impact: Accumulates old files

### Payment Issues
- **Session persistence**: `/src/server/services/stripe.ts` (line 258)
  - Missing: Validation and retry logic
  - Impact: Stale checkout sessions

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Weeks 1-2)
1. Implement storage file cleanup on invoice delete
   - Fetch order_files before DB delete
   - Delete storage files before DB cascade
   - Add transaction wrapper

2. Add tmp_files cleanup job
   - Implement scheduled job (TTL-based)
   - Clean files older than 30 days
   - Add dry-run mode for testing

3. Add Stripe session validation
   - Validate session before returning URL
   - Add retry logic for failed operations
   - Clear stale sessions

### Phase 2: Additional Improvements (Weeks 3-4)
1. Implement file deletion API
   - DELETE /api/invoices/{id}/files/{fileId}
   - DELETE /api/invoices/{id}/attachments/{id}
   - Include storage cleanup

2. Fix database constraints
   - Update processor_id constraint to composite
   - Add migration script
   - Test with multiple payment providers

3. Add comprehensive tests
   - Integration tests for payment flow
   - Storage cleanup verification
   - Cross-client isolation tests

---

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Tests Needed
```typescript
// Webhook idempotency
test('webhook event processed once', async () => {
  const event = createStripeEvent();
  await webhook(event);
  await webhook(event); // Same event again
  const payments = await getPayments();
  expect(payments).toHaveLength(1);
});

// Storage cleanup
test('invoice deletion removes storage files', async () => {
  const invoice = await createInvoice();
  const files = await uploadFiles(invoice.id);
  await deleteInvoice(invoice.id);
  const remaining = await getOrderFiles(invoice.id);
  expect(remaining).toHaveLength(0);
});

// Cross-client isolation
test('client cannot access other client files', async () => {
  const file = await getOrderFile(othersFile.id, clientA);
  expect(file).toBeUndefined();
});
```

### Manual Testing
1. Complete upload → slice → checkout flow
2. Trigger Stripe webhook (use test mode)
3. Verify invoice status and payment recorded
4. Delete invoice and verify storage cleanup
5. Check signed URL expiration (5 minutes)

## Deployment Checklist

Before production deployment:
- [ ] Implement storage cleanup on invoice delete
- [ ] Add scheduled tmp_files cleanup
- [ ] Add Stripe session validation
- [ ] Run all critical tests
- [ ] Review and update security policies
- [ ] Configure Stripe webhook signing secret
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Document file retention policy
- [ ] Document disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Perform load testing with typical file sizes

---

## Configuration

### Supabase Storage Buckets
```
tmp                 - Temporary processing files (auto-cleanup every 30 days)
order-files         - Permanent 3D model files (linked to invoices)
attachments         - Invoice attachments (cascade delete with invoice)
pdfs                - Generated PDFs (manual lifecycle management)
```

### Stripe Configuration
```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY          - API key for checkout creation
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET      - Secret for webhook signature verification
STRIPE_SUCCESS_URL         - Redirect after successful payment
STRIPE_CANCEL_URL          - Redirect after cancelled payment
STRIPE_CURRENCY            - Currency code (default: AUD)
```

### Database
```
webhook_events    - Tracks processed Stripe events (prevents duplicates)
order_files       - Permanent file references with metadata
tmp_files         - Ephemeral processing files
payments          - Payment records with processor details
```

---

## Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Storage bucket sizes (tmp, order-files, attachments)
- Orphaned file counts (files without matching DB records)
- Stripe webhook delivery rate and latency
- Failed Stripe checkout sessions
- Payment processing time (create → webhook → recorded)
- File upload success rate by size/type

### Alerts to Configure
- Storage usage exceeds 80% quota
- Webhook processing failure rate > 1%
- Payment recording delay > 5 minutes
- Orphaned tmp_files older than 60 days
- Database cascade delete cascades > 1000 records

---

## Security Considerations

### Current Security Model
- ✅ Service role for all API queries (bypasses RLS)
- ✅ Application-layer permission enforcement
- ✅ Signed URLs for file downloads (5 min expiration)
- ✅ Webhook signature verification
- ✅ Idempotency protection on webhooks

### Potential Improvements
- Add rate limiting on file upload
- Add malware scanning on uploaded files
- Add encryption for sensitive file metadata
- Add audit logging for admin file access
- Add role-based access control for specific files

---

## Performance Optimization

### Current Performance
- File upload: <100ms (depends on file size)
- Invoice creation: <500ms (includes file processing)
- Stripe checkout: <1s (external API)
- Webhook processing: <500ms (payment recording)

### Optimization Opportunities
- Add database query caching for frequently accessed invoices
- Implement file upload chunking for large files
- Add connection pooling for database queries
- Optimize Stripe API calls (batch operations)
- Add CDN for PDF downloads
