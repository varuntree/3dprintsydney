## Key Findings

### Working Well ✅
- **Payment Processing**: Robust Stripe integration with idempotency checks
- **Authorization**: Multi-layer permission enforcement (app-layer + RLS)
- **File Organization**: Proper bucket separation and path structure
- **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints with correct cascade policies
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error patterns and logging

### Critical Gaps ❌

1. **Storage File Cleanup**
   - When invoices are deleted, database records cascade delete but storage files remain orphaned
   - Affects: order-files bucket and attachments bucket
   - Priority: **HIGH** - leads to storage space leaks
   - Fix: Implement cleanup in `deleteInvoice()` service function

2. **Temporary File Cleanup**
   - No automatic cleanup of abandoned tmp_files
   - Priority: **HIGH** - accumulates test data and failed uploads
   - Fix: Add scheduled cleanup job with TTL-based deletion

3. **Stripe Session Staleness**
   - Session data persists after payment if webhook fails
   - Priority: **MEDIUM** - affects user experience
   - Fix: Add retry logic and validation for session expiration

### Medium Gaps ⚠️

4. **Missing File Deletion API**
   - No DELETE endpoint for files on invoices
   - Users cannot remove unnecessary files
   - Fix: Implement DELETE handlers with proper cleanup

5. **Payment Processor ID Constraint**
   - Should be UNIQUE(processor, processor_id) not just UNIQUE(processor_id)
   - Fix: Update database constraint

## System Architecture

```
Client Browser
    ↓
    ├─→ POST /api/quick-order/upload
    │   └─→ saveTmpFile() [tmp bucket]
    │
    ├─→ POST /api/quick-order/slice
    │   └─→ sliceQuickOrderFile() [CuraEngine processing]
    │
    └─→ POST /api/quick-order/checkout
        └─→ createQuickOrderInvoice()
            ├─→ saveOrderFile() [order-files bucket]
            └─→ createStripeCheckoutSession()
                └─→ Stripe.checkout.sessions.create()

Stripe
    ↓
    └─→ POST /api/stripe/webhook
        └─→ handleStripeEvent()
            └─→ markInvoicePaid()
                └─→ addManualPayment() [RPC transaction]
```

## Security Model

- **Service Role Pattern**: All API routes use Supabase service role (bypasses RLS)
- **Application-Layer Enforcement**: Permission checks in route handlers
- **Defensive RLS**: Secondary RLS policies on tables (e.g., order_files)
- **Idempotency**: Webhook events tracked to prevent duplicate payments

## Storage Buckets

| Bucket | Retention | Cleanup |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| tmp | Ephemeral | Manual (missing scheduled cleanup) |
| order-files | Permanent | Cascade delete (missing storage cleanup) |
| attachments | Permanent | Cascade delete (missing storage cleanup) |
| pdfs | Permanent | Manual only |

## Database Key Relationships

```
clients (1)
    ├─→ (M) invoices (cascade delete)
    │       ├─→ (M) invoice_items (cascade delete)
    │       ├─→ (M) payments (cascade delete)
    │       ├─→ (M) jobs (cascade delete)
    │       └─→ (M) attachments (cascade delete)
    │
    └─→ (M) order_files
        └─→ (1) invoices OR (1) quotes (cascade delete)
```

## Payment Flow (Stripe)

```
Invoice Created
    ↓ User initiates payment
    ↓ GET /api/invoices/{id}/stripe-session
    ↓ Creates Stripe session with metadata: { invoiceId }
    ↓ Returns checkout URL
    ↓ Client completes payment in Stripe UI
    ↓
Stripe Webhook: checkout.session.completed
    ↓ POST /api/stripe/webhook
    ↓ Idempotency check (webhook_events table)
    ↓ Extract invoiceId from session metadata
    ↓ addManualPayment() creates payment record
    ↓ Update invoice: status = PAID, balance_due = 0
    ↓ Clear stripe_session_id and stripe_checkout_url
    ↓
Invoice Status: PAID ✅
```

## Recommendation Priority

| Priority | Item | Effort | Impact |
|----------|------|--------|--------|
| **HIGH** | Implement storage cleanup on invoice delete | 2-4 hours | Prevents storage leaks |
| **HIGH** | Add scheduled cleanup for tmp_files | 1-2 hours | Saves storage space |
| **HIGH** | Add Stripe session validation/retry | 2-3 hours | Improves reliability |
| MEDIUM | Implement file deletion API | 1-2 hours | Better UX |
| MEDIUM | Fix processor_id constraint | 30 min | Multi-provider support |
| LOW | Document file retention policy | 1 hour | Operational clarity |

## Testing Strategy

**Critical Tests** (should be automated):
1. Webhook idempotency (send same event twice, verify payment recorded once)
2. Cross-client isolation (client A cannot access client B's files)
3. Storage file cleanup (invoice deletion removes all files)
4. Signed URL expiration (5-minute expiration enforced)
5. Invoice state validation (cannot pay already-paid invoice)

**Manual Testing**:
1. Complete upload → slice → checkout flow
2. Stripe payment with webhook simulation
3. File download with signed URL
4. Invoice deletion with file cleanup verification

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Implement storage cleanup in deleteInvoice()
- [ ] Add scheduled job for tmp_files cleanup (30-day TTL)
- [ ] Add Stripe session validation before returning URL
- [ ] Implement DELETE endpoint for order files
- [ ] Fix payment processor_id constraint
- [ ] Add comprehensive e2e tests for payment flow
- [ ] Document file retention policy
- [ ] Update deployment checklist with cleanup strategy

## Risk Assessment

**Current Production Readiness**:
- Payment Processing: **READY** ✅
- File Storage: **NOT READY** ⚠️ (cleanup issues)
- Data Access: **READY** ✅
- Overall: **CONDITIONAL** ⚠️ (requires cleanup implementation)

**Recommend**: Implement storage cleanup and tmp_files cleanup before production deployment with high-volume usage.

## Files Analyzed

- **API Routes**: 82 route files (quick-order, invoices, payments, etc.)
- **Services**: 22 service files (stripe, invoices, order-files, tmp-files, etc.)
- **Database Migrations**: 10 migration files (schema, RLS, functions)
- **Storage**: 1 main storage service (supabase.ts with 255 lines)
- **Auth**: Permission enforcement in 4 main files
