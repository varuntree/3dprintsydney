# Storage, Database, and Payments Verification Report
## 3D Print Sydney Application

**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**System**: Storage (Supabase), Database (PostgreSQL via Supabase), Payments (Stripe)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The application implements a complete end-to-end workflow for managing 3D print orders with file storage, database persistence, and payment processing. The implementation demonstrates good architectural separation of concerns with well-defined service layers, RLS policies for data access control, and proper error handling. However, some gaps exist in file cleanup documentation and certain edge cases in the payment flow.

---

## 1. STORAGE - CLIENT ORDER FILES

### 1.1 Storage Buckets Overview

Four Supabase Storage buckets are configured:

| Bucket | Purpose | Retention | Access Pattern |
|--------|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| `attachments` | Invoice attachments (PDFs, images) | Permanent (cascade delete with invoice) | Invoice-scoped, per-file signed URLs |
| `pdfs` | Generated invoice/quote PDFs | Permanent (manual management) | Server-side generation, signed URLs |
| `tmp` | Temporary uploaded files (3D models, slicing results) | Per-user workspace | User-scoped, automatic cleanup on use |
| `order-files` | Permanent 3D model files linked to orders | Permanent (cascade delete with invoice/quote) | Client-scoped, permanent reference |

**Location**: `/src/server/storage/supabase.ts`

### 1.2 Upload Flow - Client Order Files

#### Quick Order Upload (Client-Initiated)
```
Client Browser
    ↓ POST /api/quick-order/upload (multipart/form-data)
    ↓
Route Handler: /src/app/api/quick-order/upload/route.ts
    ↓ validateOrderFile() → validate size, type, name
    ↓ requireAuth() → ensures authenticated user
    ↓
Service Layer: saveTmpFile() → /src/server/services/tmp-files.ts
    ↓ uploadToStorage(userId, filename, buffer, contentType)
    ↓
Storage: /src/server/storage/supabase.ts
    ↓ supabase.storage.from('tmp').upload(key, buffer)
    ↓ key format: {userId}/{randomUUID()}/{filename}
    ↓
Database: tmp_files table
    - Stores metadata, status, mime_type, size_bytes, metadata (JSONB for processing state)
    ↓
Response: { id: tmpId, filename, size, type }
```

**File Validation** (`/src/lib/utils/validators.ts` - implied):
- Checks file size
- Validates MIME type (likely 3D model formats: STL, OBJ, etc.)
- Validates filename

**Key Implementation**:
```typescript
// saveTmpFile in /src/server/services/tmp-files.ts
- Uploads to tmp bucket with structured path: {userId}/{randomUUID()}/{filename}
- Creates DB record with status 'idle' (ready for processing)
- Returns storage_key (used as tmpId) and record metadata
- On failure: automatically deletes storage file (cleanup on error)
```

#### Quick Order Processing & Permanent Storage
```
Uploaded Tmp File
    ↓ sliceQuickOrderFile() → /src/server/services/quick-order.ts
    ↓ Uses CuraEngine/slicer CLI for 3D model processing
    ↓ Updates tmp_files.metadata with { status: 'running', attempts, settings, metrics }
    ↓
On Success:
    ↓ saveOrderFile() → links to invoice/quote
    ↓ uploadOrderFile() → moves to order-files bucket
    ↓ key format: {clientId}/{randomUUID()}/{filename}
    ↓
Database: order_files table
    - Stores: id, invoice_id, quote_id, client_id, filename, storage_key, file_type
    - Metadata: JSONB with print settings, slicing metrics, orientation
    ↓
Temp file status updated to 'completed' or 'failed'
```

**Key Implementation**:
```typescript
// order_files migration (202510191600_order_files.sql)
- Has CHECK constraint: (invoice_id IS NOT NULL OR quote_id IS NOT NULL)
- Indexed for fast lookup by invoice, quote, client, storage_key
- RLS policies enabled for admin/client access control
```

### 1.3 Access Control - File Download

#### API: GET /api/order-files/[id]
**Location**: `/src/app/api/order-files/[id]/route.ts`

```typescript
GET /api/order-files/{fileId}
    ↓ requireAuth() → verify user is authenticated
    ↓ getOrderFile(fileId) → fetch DB record
    ↓ Authorization check:
       - If user.role === 'ADMIN' → allow all
       - Else if user.clientId === file.client_id → allow
       - Else → forbidden (403)
    ↓ getOrderFileDownloadUrl(fileId, 300) → 5-min signed URL
    ↓ Response: { id, filename, fileType, mimeType, sizeBytes, downloadUrl, metadata, uploadedAt }
```

**Who Can Access What**:
- **Admins**: All files (via RLS policy "Admins can view all order files")
- **Clients**: Only their own files (via RLS policy "Clients can view own order files")
- **API Route**: Enforces access check before returning signed URL

**Signed URL Expiration**: 300 seconds (5 minutes) - requires regeneration for re-downloads

### 1.4 Deletion Logic

#### Explicit Deletion
**Order Files**: 
```typescript
// deleteOrderFile() in /src/server/services/order-files.ts
- Line 189-203
- Deletes DB record first (by ID)
- Then deletes storage file (best-effort, ignores errors)
- Logs deletion event
- Called when invoice/quote is deleted (cascade)
```

**Invoice Attachments**:
```typescript
// deleteInvoiceAttachment() in /src/server/storage/supabase.ts
- Line 104-110: Delete single attachment by path
- Line 112-114: Batch delete multiple attachments
```

#### Implicit Deletion (Cascade)
**Database Cascade Deletes** (from init.sql):
- `invoices` deletion → cascade deletes `invoice_items`, `payments`, `jobs`, `attachments`
- `quotes` deletion → cascade deletes `quote_items`, `order_files` (if quote_id)
- Order files with invoice_id cascade delete when invoice is deleted

**Storage Cleanup**:
- **No automatic storage cleanup on invoice delete** - Database records cascade delete, but storage files must be manually managed
- **Gap identified**: Storage cleanup logic not documented/implemented in deleteInvoice()

### 1.5 Temporary File Cleanup

```typescript
// deleteTmpFile() in /src/server/services/tmp-files.ts
- Line 179-189: Delete tmp file and DB record
- Requires user ownership validation first (forbids cross-user deletion)
- On checkout/invoice creation: tmp files are NOT auto-deleted

// saveTmpFile cleanup on error
- Line 68: If DB insert fails, deletes from storage automatically
```

**Gap**: No automatic cleanup of orphaned tmp files (e.g., if user uploads but never converts to order)

---

## 2. DATABASE ACCESS PATTERNS

### 2.1 Database Schema

**Core Tables**:
- `clients` (source of truth for client info)
- `invoices` (orders with pricing & payment status)
- `invoice_items` (line items on invoices)
- `quotes` (quotations before conversion to invoice)
- `order_files` (permanent 3D model file references)
- `attachments` (files attached to invoices)
- `payments` (payment records linked to invoices)
- `jobs` (printing job records)
- `tmp_files` (ephemeral processing files)

**Key Foreign Keys** (all with proper deletion policies):
```sql
invoices -> clients (ON DELETE CASCADE)
invoice_items -> invoices (ON DELETE CASCADE)
payments -> invoices (ON DELETE CASCADE)
jobs -> invoices (ON DELETE CASCADE)
attachments -> invoices (ON DELETE CASCADE)
order_files -> invoices (ON DELETE CASCADE) AND quotes (ON DELETE CASCADE)
order_files -> clients (ON DELETE CASCADE)
```

### 2.2 Client Data Access Patterns

#### Clients Can Access:
1. **Their own invoices** (via `/api/client/invoices`)
   - Enforced: Service-role queries + app-layer permission checks
   
2. **Their own jobs** (via `/api/client/jobs`)
   - Permission check in route handler
   
3. **Their own order files** (via `/api/order-files/[id]`)
   - Client must own the file (clientId match)
   
4. **Dashboard data** (via `/api/client/dashboard`)
   - Client-specific aggregations

#### Query Pattern (Client Context):
```typescript
// Example from /src/server/services/invoices.ts
const supabase = getServiceSupabase(); // Uses service role (bypasses RLS)
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('invoices')
  .select('...')
  .eq('client_id', clientId) // Filtered at app layer
  .order('issue_date', { ascending: false });

// Permission enforcement in API route handler
await requireInvoiceAccess(request, invoiceId);
// Returns 403 if user.role !== 'ADMIN' AND user.clientId !== invoice.client_id
```

### 2.3 Admin Data Access Patterns

#### Admins Can Access:
1. **All invoices** (no filter in service layer)
2. **All clients** (no filter)
3. **All jobs** (no filter)
4. **All order files** (RLS policy allows)
5. **Bulk operations**: export, reporting, analytics

#### Query Pattern (Admin Context):
```typescript
// No clientId filtering applied
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('invoices')
  .select('...') // All invoices, no WHERE clause
  .order('issue_date');
```

### 2.4 Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

**Current Implementation** (from migrations):

#### Service Role Bypass
```sql
-- File: 202510161805_policies.sql
-- All tables have permissive service-role policies
CREATE POLICY clients_service_role_access ON clients FOR ALL USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);
CREATE POLICY invoices_service_role_access ON invoices FOR ALL USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);
-- ... similar for all major tables
```

**Impact**: Service role (used by all API routes) can read/write everything. RLS enforcement is handled at the **application layer** via permission checks like `requireInvoiceAccess()`.

#### Order Files RLS
```sql
-- Admins can see all files
CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all order files"
  ON order_files FOR select
  USING (
    EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE users.id = auth.uid()::text::bigint AND users.role = 'ADMIN')
  );

-- Clients see their own
CREATE POLICY "Clients can view own order files"
  ON order_files FOR select
  USING (
    EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE users.id = auth.uid()::text::bigint AND users.client_id = order_files.client_id)
  );
```

**Note**: These RLS policies are *defensive* (not used in current flow since service role bypasses them).

## 3. PAYMENTS - STRIPE INTEGRATION

### 3.1 Payment Flow Overview

```
Client Invoice
    ↓
Admin/Client initiates Stripe checkout
    ↓ POST /api/invoices/{id}/stripe-session
    ↓
Service: createStripeCheckoutSession()
    ↓ Checks invoice not already paid
    ↓ Calculates amount due
    ↓ Creates Stripe session with metadata: { invoiceId, invoiceNumber }
    ↓ Stores session ID & URL in invoices table
    ↓ Logs activity
    ↓
Response: { url: checkout_url, sessionId: session_id }
    ↓
Client redirected to Stripe checkout
    ↓ Completes payment in Stripe UI
    ↓
Stripe sends webhook: checkout.session.completed
    ↓ POST /api/stripe/webhook
    ↓
Handler: handleStripeEvent()
    ↓ Idempotency check: Has event already been processed?
    ↓ If not: extract invoiceId from session.metadata
    ↓ markInvoicePaid(invoiceId, { method: STRIPE, amount, processor, reference })
    ↓
Payment recorded, invoice status → PAID, balance_due → 0
    ↓
Activity logged, Stripe session cleared from invoice record
```

### 3.2 Stripe Checkout Implementation

**File**: `/src/server/services/stripe.ts`

```typescript
createStripeCheckoutSession(invoiceId, options?)
  ↓ Load invoice record: SELECT id, status, stripe_session_id, stripe_checkout_url
  ↓ Validate state:
     - If status === 'PAID' → throw BadRequestError
     - If already has stripe_checkout_url and not refreshing → return existing URL
  ↓
  ↓ Get invoice detail: balanceDue amount
  ↓ Validate amount > 0
  ↓
  ↓ Create Stripe session:
     - mode: 'payment'
     - payment_method_types: ['card']
     - line_items: [{ price_data: { currency, product_data: { name, description }, unit_amount } }]
     - metadata: { invoiceId, invoiceNumber }
     - success_url & cancel_url from env config
  ↓
  ↓ Update invoices table:
     - stripe_session_id
     - stripe_checkout_url
  ↓
  ↓ Log activity: 'STRIPE_CHECKOUT_CREATED'
  ↓
  Return { url, sessionId }
```

### 3.3 Webhook Handler - Payment Processing

**File**: `/src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`

```typescript
POST /api/stripe/webhook
  ↓ Parse Stripe signature & construct event
  ↓ Call handleStripeEvent(event)
  ↓
  ↓ EVENT: checkout.session.completed
       ↓ Extract session data
       ↓ Get invoiceId from session.metadata
       ↓
       ↓ IDEMPOTENCY CHECK:
          SELECT FROM webhook_events WHERE stripe_event_id = event.id
          If exists → skip processing (already handled)
       ↓
       ↓ Call markInvoicePaid(invoiceId, {
            method: PaymentMethod.STRIPE,
            amount: session.amount_total / 100,
            processor: 'stripe',
            processorId: session.payment_intent || session.id,
            reference: session.id,
            note: 'Stripe Checkout payment'
          })
       ↓
       ↓ Clear Stripe session fields from invoice:
          UPDATE invoices SET stripe_session_id = NULL, stripe_checkout_url = NULL
       ↓
       ↓ Log activity: 'STRIPE_CHECKOUT_COMPLETED'
       ↓
       ↓ Record event in webhook_events table for idempotency
       ↓
  ↓
  ↓ Return { received: true } (HTTP 200)
```

### 3.4 Payment Recording - Database

**File**: `/src/server/services/invoices.ts`

#### markInvoicePaid()
```typescript
markInvoicePaid(invoiceId, options?)
  ↓ Validate invoice not already paid
  ↓
  ↓ If options.amount > 0:
       → Call addManualPayment() (creates payment record)
       → Updates balance_due
       → Returns payment record
  ↓
  ↓ Else (amount === 0 or not provided):
       → UPDATE invoices:
          - status = 'PAID'
          - balance_due = '0'
          - paid_at = current timestamp
       ↓
       → Log activity: 'INVOICE_MARKED_PAID'
       ↓
       → Check job creation policy:
          If 'ON_PAYMENT' → create job now
       ↓
       → Return null (no payment record created for 0-amount)
```

**Gap identified**: When Stripe payment is received, `markInvoicePaid()` is called with amount > 0, which triggers `addManualPayment()`. This creates a proper payment record AND updates status to PAID.

#### addManualPayment()
```typescript
addManualPayment(invoiceId, { amount, method, reference, processor, processorId, notes, paidAt })
  ↓ Call RPC: add_invoice_payment (atomic operation)
     - Inserts payment record
     - Updates invoices table:
        - If total paid >= total amount → status = 'PAID', balance_due = 0
        - Else → balance_due -= payment.amount
  ↓
  ↓ Log activity: 'INVOICE_PAYMENT_ADDED'
  ↓
  ↓ If invoice now PAID and policy is 'ON_PAYMENT':
       → ensureJobForInvoice() (creates printing job)
  ↓
  Return payment record
```

### 3.5 Payment Methods Supported

From enum `payment_method`:
```sql
CREATE TYPE payment_method AS ENUM ('STRIPE','BANK_TRANSFER','CASH','OTHER');
```

**Methods**:
1. **STRIPE** - Checkout payments via webhook
2. **BANK_TRANSFER** - Manual entry by admin
3. **CASH** - Manual entry by admin
4. **OTHER** - Generic manual entry

### 3.6 Invoice Status Transitions

```
PENDING
  ↓ (on payment)
  ↓
PAID
  ↓ (on write-off or void)
  ↓
(terminal states)

PENDING → OVERDUE (after due_date + overdue_days, calculated at query time)
```

**Payment Impact**:
- On payment receipt (any method) → status = PAID
- balance_due recalculated from: total - sum(all payments)
- Stripe sessions cleared after payment recorded

---

## 4. INTEGRATION POINTS

### 4.1 File → Invoice Linking

```
Order File Uploads (Quick Order)
    ↓ saveTmpFile() → creates tmp_files record
    ↓
    ↓ sliceQuickOrderFile() → processes with slicer
    ↓
    ↓ processQuickOrderFiles() → saves as order_files
       - Calls saveOrderFile() with invoiceId
       - Links file to invoice via order_files.invoice_id foreign key
       ↓
    ↓ order_files table relationships:
       - invoice_id (nullable, CASCADE delete)
       - quote_id (nullable, CASCADE delete)
       - client_id (required, CASCADE delete)
```

**Flow**: tmp_files (ephemeral) → order_files (permanent) → invoice_id creates link

### 4.2 Payment → Invoice/Job Status

```
Payment Received (Stripe webhook)
    ↓ handleStripeEvent(checkout.session.completed)
    ↓
    ↓ Extract amount & invoiceId from session metadata
    ↓
    ↓ addManualPayment(invoiceId, { amount, method: STRIPE })
    ↓
    ↓ Database RPC: add_invoice_payment
       - INSERT into payments
       - UPDATE invoices: status, balance_due
       ↓
    ↓ If invoice now PAID:
       - Check job_creation_policy setting
       - If 'ON_PAYMENT': ensureJobForInvoice(invoiceId)
         → Creates job record linked to invoice
         → Job initially in 'PRE_PROCESSING' status
```

**Key Insight**: Payment doesn't directly create job - policy setting (`ON_INVOICE` vs `ON_PAYMENT`) determines timing.

### 4.3 Data Flow Integrity

**Constraints Verified**:
1. ✅ Foreign key relationships all have explicit delete policies (CASCADE or SET NULL)
2. ✅ order_files has CHECK constraint (invoice_id OR quote_id not null)
3. ✅ Invoices linked to exactly one client (not null)
4. ✅ Payments linked to exactly one invoice
5. ✅ Jobs linked to exactly one invoice and client

**Potential Gaps**:
1. ❌ Orphaned tmp_files if user abandons upload mid-process
2. ❌ No explicit cleanup of Stripe session data if webhook fails
3. ❌ No explicit cleanup of storage files when invoice deleted (DB cascade only)

---

## 5. SECURITY ANALYSIS

### 5.1 Authorization Controls

**Invoice Access**:
- ✅ `requireInvoiceAccess()` enforces: admin OR owner
- ✅ Applied to: GET, PUT, DELETE invoice endpoints
- ✅ Prevents cross-client access

**Order File Access**:
- ✅ GET /api/order-files/[id] checks: admin OR file.client_id === user.clientId
- ✅ Prevents direct storage access (must go through signed URLs)
- ✅ RLS policies provide secondary layer

**Payment Access**:
- ✅ Payments linked to invoices → inherit invoice access control

### 5.2 Sensitive Data Protection

**Stripe Session Details**:
- ✅ Session URLs stored in database but only returned to authorized user
- ✅ Webhook signature verified via Stripe secret

**Order Files**:
- ✅ Storage keys not exposed directly (only through signed URLs)
- ✅ Client-scoped storage paths limit discovery

**Payments**:
- ✅ Payment records marked with method & processor
- ✅ Processor IDs (Stripe payment_intent) tracked separately

### 5.3 Idempotency & Webhook Safety

**Stripe Webhook Handling**:
```typescript
// webhook_events table (created in 202510191545_webhook_idempotency.sql)
// Stores: stripe_event_id, event_type, metadata
// Prevents duplicate payment processing if webhook retried by Stripe
```

- ✅ Checks webhook_events before processing
- ✅ Records event after processing
- ✅ Prevents double-charging if Stripe resends event

---

## 6. ISSUES & GAPS IDENTIFIED

### Critical Issues

**None identified** - Payment flow is robust with idempotency, proper state validation, and error handling.

### High Priority Gaps

1. **Storage File Cleanup on Invoice Deletion**
   - **Issue**: When invoice is deleted, database records cascade delete, but Supabase storage files (order_files, attachments) remain orphaned
   - **Location**: `deleteInvoice()` in `/src/server/services/invoices.ts` (line 533)
   - **Impact**: Storage space leaks, orphaned files accumulate
   - **Recommendation**: 
     ```typescript
     export async function deleteInvoice(id: number) {
       const supabase = getServiceSupabase();
       
       // 1. Fetch all files linked to invoice
       const { data: files } = await supabase
         .from('order_files')
         .select('storage_key')
         .eq('invoice_id', id);
       
       // 2. Fetch all attachments
       const { data: attachments } = await supabase
         .from('attachments')
         .select('storage_key')
         .eq('invoice_id', id);
       
       // 3. Delete database records (cascade)
       const { data } = await supabase
         .from('invoices')
         .delete()
         .eq('id', id)
         .select('id, client_id, number')
         .single();
       
       // 4. Delete storage files
       if (files?.length) {
         await Promise.all(files.map(f => deleteOrderFile(f.storage_key)));
       }
       if (attachments?.length) {
         await deleteInvoiceAttachments(attachments.map(a => a.storage_key));
       }
       
       // 5. Log activity
       await insertInvoiceActivities(id, data.client_id, 'INVOICE_DELETED', ...);
     }
     ```

2. **Orphaned Temporary Files**
   - **Issue**: tmp_files and tmp bucket storage have no automatic cleanup
   - **Location**: `/src/server/services/tmp-files.ts`
   - **Impact**: Accumulation of failed uploads, test data
   - **Recommendation**: 
     - Implement scheduled job to clean tmp_files older than N days
     - Or add client-side cleanup when user navigates away from upload UI
     - Consider adding TTL to tmp_files table (created_at + interval)

3. **Stripe Session Persistence**
   - **Issue**: If webhook fails after payment processing, Stripe session data remains in invoice record
   - **Location**: `/src/server/services/stripe.ts` (line 258)
   - **Impact**: Stale checkout URLs, confusing user state
   - **Recommendation**: 
     - Add retry logic with exponential backoff for session cleanup
     - Or add scheduled cleanup for unpaid invoices with expired Stripe sessions
     - Check if session is still valid before returning to user

### Medium Priority Gaps

4. **Missing File Deletion API**
   - **Issue**: No endpoint to delete order files or attachments
   - **Endpoints**: GET, POST for files but no DELETE
   - **Location**: `/src/app/api/invoices/[id]/files/` (missing DELETE endpoint)
   - **Impact**: Users/admins cannot remove unnecessary files from invoice
   - **Recommendation**: Implement DELETE handler with proper cleanup

5. **Payment Processor ID Uniqueness**
   - **Issue**: `payments.processor_id` has UNIQUE constraint but should be composite (processor + processor_id)
   - **Location**: Schema line 215: `processor_id text unique`
   - **Impact**: Could fail if multiple payment providers return same ID format
   - **Recommendation**: 
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE payments DROP CONSTRAINT processor_id_key;
     ALTER TABLE payments ADD CONSTRAINT processor_id_unique UNIQUE (processor, processor_id);
     ```

### Low Priority Items

6. **Documentation Gaps**
   - No documented file deletion policy/retention schedule
   - No documented backup/archival policy for completed orders
   - Missing error scenarios documentation (e.g., Stripe session creation failure)

---

## 7. WHAT'S WORKING WELL

### Strengths

1. **Comprehensive Authorization**
   - ✅ Multi-level permission checks (requireInvoiceAccess, client ownership validation)
   - ✅ Prevents unauthorized data access
   - ✅ Scales to support team members in future

2. **Robust Payment Processing**
   - ✅ Idempotency ensures no double-charging
   - ✅ Proper webhook signature verification
   - ✅ State validation before processing
   - ✅ Atomic payment recording with balance recalculation
   - ✅ Automatic job creation tied to payment status

3. **File Organization**
   - ✅ Separate buckets for different file types (tmp, order-files, attachments, pdfs)
   - ✅ User/client-scoped storage paths prevent conflicts
   - ✅ Proper MIME type handling and content-type headers
   - ✅ Signed URLs prevent direct storage exposure

4. **Database Design**
   - ✅ Proper foreign key constraints with explicit delete policies
   - ✅ Cascade deletes prevent orphaned records
   - ✅ Indexes on frequently queried columns
   - ✅ JSONB metadata fields for extensibility

5. **Error Handling**
   - ✅ Consistent AppError pattern with codes and HTTP status
   - ✅ Graceful degradation (e.g., Stripe checkout optional, continues if unavailable)
   - ✅ Error logging with scope and context

6. **Access Control**
   - ✅ Application-layer permission enforcement
   - ✅ Defensive RLS policies as secondary layer
   - ✅ Service role used safely with app-layer checks

## 8. TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS

### Critical Test Cases

1. **Storage Cleanup**
   ```
   Test: Delete invoice with order files and attachments
   Expected: All storage files deleted, DB records cascade deleted
   Current: ❌ Missing storage cleanup
   ```

2. **Stripe Webhook Idempotency**
   ```
   Test: Send same webhook event twice
   Expected: Second event ignored, no duplicate payment
   Current: ✅ webhook_events table tracks processed events
   ```

3. **Payment State Validation**
   ```
   Test: Mark already-paid invoice as paid again
   Expected: Reject with BadRequestError
   Current: ✅ Validated in markInvoicePaid()
   ```

4. **Cross-Client Isolation**
   ```
   Test: Client A tries to access Client B's invoice
   Expected: 403 Forbidden
   Current: ✅ Enforced in requireInvoiceAccess()
   ```

5. **File Access Control**
   ```
   Test: Get signed URL for file, use after expiration
   Expected: 403 Forbidden or regenerate URL
   Current: ✅ 300-second signed URL expiration
   ```

6. **Temporary File Cleanup**
   ```
   Test: Upload file, don't complete checkout, wait
   Expected: Temporary files cleaned up after N days
   Current: ❌ No cleanup mechanism exists
   ```

---

## 9. DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

- ✅ Supabase storage buckets created (attachments, pdfs, tmp, order-files)
- ✅ Database migrations applied (schema, RLS, functions)
- ✅ Stripe API key configured in environment
- ✅ Webhook signing secret configured
- ✅ Success/cancel URLs configured for Stripe sessions
- ⚠️ File cleanup strategy documented and configured
- ⚠️ Backup strategy for order-files bucket documented
- ❌ File deletion API implemented and tested

---

## 10. RECOMMENDATIONS SUMMARY

| Priority | Item | Status | Action |
|----------|------|--------|--------|
| Critical | Storage cleanup on invoice delete | ❌ Missing | Implement cleanup in deleteInvoice() |
| High | Orphaned tmp file cleanup | ❌ Missing | Add scheduled cleanup or TTL |
| High | Stripe session expiration handling | ⚠️ Partial | Add validation and retry logic |
| Medium | File deletion API endpoint | ❌ Missing | Implement DELETE handlers |
| Medium | Payment processor_id uniqueness | ⚠️ Incorrect | Update constraint to composite |
| Low | Documentation | ⚠️ Partial | Document file retention policy |

## CONCLUSION

The application demonstrates a well-architected system for managing 3D print orders with proper separation of concerns between storage, database, and payments layers. The Stripe integration is robust and idempotent, preventing common payment issues. The main gaps are around cleanup and deletion workflows, which should be addressed before production use with high-volume file uploads.

**Readiness Assessment**: 
- Payment Processing: **READY** ✅
- File Storage: **READY WITH CAVEATS** ⚠️ (cleanup needed)
- Data Access Control: **READY** ✅
- Overall: **MOSTLY READY** ⚠️ (cleanup workflows need implementation)
