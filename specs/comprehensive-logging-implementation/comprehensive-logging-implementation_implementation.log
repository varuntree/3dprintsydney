Implementation log started at $(date -u)
Step 1-3: Core logging, config, correlation, error mapping created
Step 4: Replaced toast.error usages with getUserMessage across client components
Steps 5-10: Instrumented services, slicer, workers, browser logger, ModelViewer, auth guards, and documentation; console.* cleaned & scope list verified.
Validation: npm run typecheck failed due to numerous pre-existing TS errors (see output); npm run build succeeded.
