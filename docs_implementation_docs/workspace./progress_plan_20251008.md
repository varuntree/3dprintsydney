# Progress Plan — October 8, 2025 Run

## Overview
This run addresses the remaining client/admin experience gaps called out in the latest review. The focus areas are quick-order usability, payment visibility, PDF/export simplification, client selection ergonomics, messaging loaders, and documentation hygiene. All work streams are owned by engineering (Varun) for this iteration.

## Task Breakdown
| ID | Area | Status | Acceptance Notes | Validation |
|----|------|--------|------------------|------------|
| C1 | Client dashboard CTAs | Completed | “Quick Order” card appears immediately beneath welcome header, styled primary blue; “View All Orders” adjacent secondary. | Manual portal check on desktop & mobile widths.
| C2 | Quick order UX overhaul | Completed | Multi-file list with removal, outlined uploader icon, materials info link, refreshed layout, animated calculate button; checkout still succeeds. | Upload/remove multiple files; compute price; ensure invoice attachments present.
| D1 | Admin revalidation | Completed | New invoices/jobs visible in admin lists without manual refresh after quick-order checkout. | Trigger quick order, then load `/invoices`, `/jobs` and confirm new record.
| D2 | Client invoices API metadata | Completed | API returns Stripe link availability and status; no breaking changes for caller. | Inspect API JSON; ensure client UI adapts.
| D3 | Client pay UX | Completed | Orders list/detail show status badge and prominent “Pay Online” button that opens fresh Stripe checkout; handles disabled Stripe gracefully. | Click pay button before/after payment (simulate). |
| E1 | PDF action simplification | Completed | Dropdown removed; invoice/quote views offer single Generate PDF button with loading state. | Trigger PDF download.
| E2 | Modal client picker | Completed | Invoice/quote editors open searchable modal; selection populates form; keyboard navigation intact. | Create new invoice/quote selecting different client.
| F1 | Messaging loader | Completed | Admin messages sidebar shows loader immediately instead of “No users”; conversation area skeleton for initial load. | Load `/messages` with seeded data.
| F2 | Notification copy | Completed | Toggle describes dependency on email send setting; messaging consistent across client/admin forms. | Toggle text matches `enableEmailSend` state.
| G1 | Documentation & QA notes | Completed | Workspace docs updated with summary + QA steps; README changes if needed. | Review doc diffs.

## Assumptions & Follow-ups
- Materials info link targets existing `/materials` admin page for now; confirm marketing wants public page link.
- Stripe remains configured during smoke; document fallback messaging if disabled.
- Email notifications remain opt-in and default off until SMTP available; toggle copy will mention requirement.

## Timeline
1. Bootstrap & docs (complete).
2. Quick client-facing adjustments (C1–C3).
3. Payment visibility (D1–D3).
4. PDF/client picker (E1–E2).
5. Messaging + notification polish (F1–F2).
6. Documentation & quality gates (G1–G3).

## QA Checklist (to execute in G2/G3)
- Client portal dashboard load, quick order flow, pay button, messaging view.
- Admin invoices/jobs refresh after quick order.
- Invoice/quote PDF download.
- Invoice/quote creation with modal picker.
