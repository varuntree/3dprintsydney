### Our Story

**Section Title:**
```
Our Story
```

**Content:**
```
3D Print Sydney was born from a simple frustration: finding fast, affordable, professional 3D printing in Sydney was nearly impossible. Most services had week-long turnarounds, opaque pricing, or required minimum order quantities.

We set out to change that.

From our facility in Elizabeth Bay, we serve everyone from tech startups in Surry Hills to students at Sydney universities, hobbyists in the Northern Beaches, and manufacturers across the metro area.

What makes us different? We actually care about your project. We're not just a print farm‚Äîwe're engineers, designers, and makers ourselves. We understand the urgency of a product launch, the budget constraints of a student project, and the precision requirements of a functional prototype.

That's why we offer same-day service, transparent pricing, student discounts, and free design consultation with every project.
```

### Our Mission

**Section Title:**
```
Our Mission
