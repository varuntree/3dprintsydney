## Routes Fixed

**Solution:**
1. Moved `(admin)/page.tsx` → `(admin)/dashboard/page.tsx`
2. Moved `(admin)/materials/page.tsx` → `(admin)/dashboard/materials-admin/page.tsx`
3. Updated middleware to redirect admins to `/dashboard` instead of `/`

| `/` | marketing | Landing page |
| `/services` | marketing | Services overview |
| `/pricing` | marketing | Pricing structure |
| `/about` | marketing | Company info |
| `/contact` | marketing | Contact form |
| `/materials` | marketing | Materials guide |
| `/portfolio` | marketing | Project showcase |
| `/dashboard` | admin | Admin dashboard |
| `/dashboard/materials-admin` | admin | Admin materials management |
