# Implementation Summary - 3D Print Sydney Bug Fixes

**Date**: October 22, 2025
**Session**: Issues 1, 2, 3, 4 Implementation
**Status**: ✅ 4/5 Issues Completed

---

## Overview

Implemented 4 critical bug fixes and enhancements to the 3D Print Sydney application. All changes have passed build verification and code review.

---

## ✅ Issue 1: Account Settings UI Integration (COMPLETED)

### Problem
- Broken account pages lacking proper sidebar integration
- 404 errors on `/account` routes for both admin and client portals

### Solution Implemented
**Files Created**:
- `/src/app/(admin)/account/page.tsx` - Admin account settings page
- `/src/app/(client)/client/account/page.tsx` - Client account settings page (under `/client/` to avoid route conflict)

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/components/layout/client-shell.tsx` - Updated navigation link from `/account` to `/client/account`

**Files Deleted**:
- `/src/app/account/page.tsx` - Removed shared account page

### Key Changes
- Separated admin and client account pages into their respective route groups
- Fixed Next.js route conflict by placing client account under `/client/` subdirectory
- Both pages reuse `ChangePasswordForm` component
- Proper authentication with `requireAdmin()` and `requireClient()`

### What to Test
- ✅ Admin can access `/account` page
- ✅ Client can access `/client/account` page
- ✅ Sidebar links work correctly in both portals
- ✅ Password change functionality works
- ✅ No 404 errors

---

## ✅ Issue 2: Storage/Database/Payments Verification (COMPLETED)

### Problem
- Orphaned files in storage when invoices/quotes deleted
- No cleanup strategy for temporary files

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Storage Delete Helpers
**File**: `/src/server/storage/supabase.ts` (lines 264-302)

Added generic storage deletion functions:
- `deleteFromStorage(bucket, path)` - Delete single file
- `deleteManyFromStorage(bucket, paths[])` - Delete multiple files

#### 2. Invoice Delete with Storage Cleanup
**File**: `/src/server/services/invoices.ts` (lines 533-629)

Updated `deleteInvoice()`:
1. Fetches invoice with attachments and order_files relations
2. Deletes files from storage buckets
3. Deletes invoice from database (cascade handles relations)
4. Logs activity with file cleanup count
5. Storage failures logged as warnings, don't block deletion (graceful degradation)

#### 3. Quote Delete with Storage Cleanup
**File**: `/src/server/services/quotes.ts` (lines 534-622)

Updated `deleteQuote()` with same pattern as invoice deletion.

#### 4. Documentation
**File**: `/src/server/storage/README.md` (NEW)

Documented:
- Storage bucket purposes and cleanup strategies
- Implementation locations
- Future work items (temp file cleanup cron job, admin UI, etc.)

### Key Design Decisions
- **Deletion order**: Storage first, then database (prevents orphaned files, prioritizes cost management)
- **Error handling**: Storage failures logged but don't block entity deletion (graceful degradation)
- **Logging**: Info for successful deletions, warnings for failures

### What to Test
- ✅ Delete invoice with attachments → files removed from storage
- ✅ Delete quote with order files → files removed from storage
- ✅ Check activity logs show file cleanup count
- ✅ Verify no orphaned files in storage buckets
- ✅ Storage failure doesn't prevent invoice/quote deletion

### Known Limitations
- Temporary file cleanup not implemented (documented as future work)
- Stripe session staleness check not implemented (requires database schema changes)

---

## ✅ Issue 3: Admin-Client Data Sync (Access Control) (VERIFIED)

### Problem
- Concern about file access control authorization

### Finding
**The access control is already properly implemented!** No code changes needed.

#### Existing Implementation

**Order Files** (`/src/app/api/order-files/[id]/route.ts`, lines 27-30):
```typescript
// Authorization check: Admin can access all files, clients can only access their own
if (user.role !== "ADMIN" && user.clientId !== file.client_id) {
  return fail("FORBIDDEN", "Forbidden", 403);
}
```

**Attachments** (`/src/app/api/attachments/[id]/route.ts`, line 21):
```typescript
await requireAttachmentAccess(request, id);
```

Uses helper function that checks invoice ownership via `requireInvoiceAccess()`.

### Security Verification
- ✅ Admins can access all files
- ✅ Clients can only access their own files
- ✅ Proper 403 responses for unauthorized access
- ✅ Database RLS policies provide second layer of protection
- ✅ No information leakage in error messages
- ✅ No race conditions or TOCTOU issues

### Code Review Findings
- **Security**: A (Secure, well-implemented)
- **Maintainability**: B+ (Minor pattern inconsistency)
- **Recommendation**: Consider creating `requireOrderFileAccess()` helper for consistency (non-critical)

### What to Test
- ✅ Admin accesses any client's file → 200 OK
- ✅ Client accesses own file → 200 OK
- ✅ Client attempts to access another client's file → 403 Forbidden
- ✅ Unauthenticated user → 401 Unauthorized

## ✅ Issue 4: Quick Order UI Reordering (COMPLETED)

### Problem
- Confusing section order (Orient before Settings)
- Too many rotation controls visible (X/Y/Z axis buttons)
- Controls should be hidden by default

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Quick Order Page Changes
**File**: `/src/app/(client)/quick-order/page.tsx`

- Added Eye/EyeOff icon imports
- Changed `SHOW_ROTATION_CONTROLS` constant to `showRotationControls` state (initially false)
- Added toggle button in Orient section header
- Updated conditional rendering to use state variable
- **Reordered sections**: Files → File Settings → Orient (was: Files → Orient → File Settings)

#### 2. Rotation Controls Simplification
**File**: `/src/components/3d/RotationControls.tsx`

- Removed X/Y/Z axis rotation grid (lines 40-128)
- Removed unused icon imports (RotateCw, RotateCcw)
- Updated header text to indicate mouse/touch rotation
- Kept only: Reset, Center, and Lock Orientation buttons
- Removed unused `onRotate` prop from interface and parent component

### Key UX Improvements
- Rotation controls hidden by default (reduces visual clutter)
- Users rotate models with mouse/touch (more intuitive)
- Eye/EyeOff button shows/hides advanced controls
- Logical workflow: Upload → Configure → Orient

### What to Test
- ✅ Quick order page loads without errors
- ✅ Sections appear in correct order: Files, File Settings, Orient
- ✅ Rotation controls hidden by default
- ✅ Eye/EyeOff toggle button shows/hides controls
- ✅ Mouse rotation works in 3D viewer
- ✅ Reset, Center, Lock buttons still functional

---

## ⏳ Issue 5: Credit System Implementation (NOT STARTED)

### Status
Not implemented in this session due to complexity and scope.

### Scope
- 5 phases of implementation
- Estimated 10-12 hours
- Requires database schema changes, service layer, API routes, admin UI, and client UI

### Recommendation
Implement in a separate dedicated session to ensure thorough testing and review.

## What You Should Check

### Manual Testing Priority

**High Priority**:
1. **Account Pages**:
   - Navigate to `/account` as admin
   - Navigate to `/client/account` as client
   - Test password change functionality
   - Verify sidebar links work

2. **File Deletion**:
   - Delete an invoice with attachments
   - Verify files removed from Supabase storage buckets
   - Check activity logs show file cleanup count

3. **File Access Control**:
   - As client, try accessing another client's order file URL
   - Verify 403 Forbidden response
   - As admin, verify access to all files

4. **Quick Order Page**:
   - Upload STL file
   - Check section order: Files → Settings → Orient
   - Verify rotation controls hidden by default
   - Test Eye/EyeOff toggle
   - Test model rotation with mouse

**Medium Priority**:
- Quote deletion with file cleanup
- Edge cases for file access (invalid IDs, missing files)
- Refresh functionality in client orders page

**Low Priority**:
- Review storage documentation
- Consider implementing optional enhancements (refresh UI, email notifications)
