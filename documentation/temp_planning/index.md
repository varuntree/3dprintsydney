## üéØ Issues Overview

### Issue 1: Account Settings UI Integration
**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: 2 hours
**Complexity**: Low

**Problem**: Account settings page exists outside route groups, lacks sidebar/header integration.

**Solution**: Create role-specific account pages in `(admin)/account` and `(client)/account` route groups to leverage existing shell layouts.

**Key Changes**:
- Create `/src/app/(admin)/account/page.tsx`
- Create `/src/app/(client)/account/page.tsx`
- Delete `/src/app/account/page.tsx`
- Reuse existing ChangePasswordForm component

**Files Modified**: 3 files (2 created, 1 deleted)
**Testing**: Manual UI verification, password change functionality

---

### Issue 2: Storage/Database/Payments Verification
**Priority**: High (Critical Fixes)
**Effort**: 4-6 hours (critical path only)
**Complexity**: Medium

**Problem**: Files not cleaned up when invoices/quotes deleted, temporary files accumulate.

**Solution**: Add storage cleanup logic to delete operations, document tmp file strategy.

**Key Changes**:
- Add file deletion to `deleteInvoice()` and `deleteQuote()`
- Create `deleteFromStorage()` helper in storage service
- Add Stripe session staleness validation
- Document temporary file cleanup strategy

**Files Modified**: 5 files
**Testing**: Storage verification, payment flow testing

**Skip**: File deletion API (optional), full tmp cleanup implementation (document only)

---

### Issue 3: Admin-Client Data Synchronization
**Priority**: High (Access Control), Low (Real-time)
**Effort**: 2-3 hours (critical only), 11-16 hours (with optional)
**Complexity**: Low (access control), High (real-time)

**Problem**: Order files lack proper authorization checks at API level.

**Solution**: Add access control to file routes, verify client ownership.

**Key Changes** (Critical):
- Add authorization to `/api/order-files/[id]/route.ts`
- Add authorization to `/api/attachments/[id]/route.ts`
- Update services to include `clientId` in DTOs

**Files Modified**: 3 files (critical path)
**Testing**: File access authorization, admin vs client access

**Skip for Now** (Optional):
- Real-time status updates via WebSocket/polling (6-8 hours)
- Email notifications (4-6 hours)
- Client-side refresh UI (1-2 hours)

**Rationale**: Current implementation works (client sees updates on page refresh). Real-time features add significant complexity for minimal UX gain.

---

### Issue 4: Quick Order UI Reordering
**Priority**: Low
**Effort**: 1.5-2.5 hours
**Complexity**: Low

**Problem**: UI component order not optimal, 3D controls too complex, always visible.

**Solution**: Reorder JSX sections, add toggle for controls, remove X/Y/Z axis controls.

**Key Changes**:
- Reorder sections in page.tsx: Files ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Orient
- Add `showRotationControls` state and toggle button
- Remove X/Y/Z grid from RotationControls component
- Keep Reset, Center, Lock buttons

**Files Modified**: 2 files
**Testing**: Visual verification, functionality testing

---

### Issue 5: Credit System Implementation
**Priority**: Medium-High
**Effort**: 11-16 hours
**Complexity**: High

**Problem**: No credit/wallet system for clients.

**Solution**: Full implementation with database schema, admin UI, client display, payment integration.

**Key Changes** (5 Phases):
1. Database migration (wallet_balance, credit_transactions table)
2. Admin credit management UI (modal to add credit)
3. Client wallet display (dashboard card)
4. Payment flow integration (deduct before Stripe)
5. Security hardening (atomic operations, locking)

**Files Created**: 4 new files
**Files Modified**: 10 files
**Testing**: Credit operations, payment flow, security validation

**Database Functions**: Atomic operations with row-level locking to prevent race conditions

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Per-Issue Testing
Each issue includes detailed testing checklist in individual plan file.

### Integration Testing (After All Issues)
1. **End-to-End Workflow**:
   - Client signup ‚Üí Admin sees in list
   - Admin adds credit ‚Üí Client sees in dashboard
   - Client uploads files ‚Üí Admin accesses files
   - Client places order with credit ‚Üí Deduction + Stripe
   - Admin updates job status ‚Üí Client sees update (on refresh)

2. **Cross-Issue Verification**:
   - Account settings accessible from both portals
   - Files properly deleted when invoices removed
   - Credit applied before Stripe checkout
   - Quick order UI reordering doesn't break workflow

3. **Regression Testing**:
   - Existing quote/invoice workflows
   - PDF generation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- **Issue 1** (Account Settings): Simple file moves, no business logic changes
- **Issue 4** (Quick Order UI): UI reordering only, state management unchanged

### Medium Risk
- **Issue 2** (Storage Cleanup): Edge case: File deletion failure shouldn't block DB deletion
- **Issue 3** (Access Control): Must thoroughly test authorization to prevent data leaks

### High Risk
- **Issue 5** (Credit System): Complex state management, race conditions possible
  - **Mitigation**: Atomic database functions with row locking
  - **Testing**: Concurrent operation tests, negative balance prevention
