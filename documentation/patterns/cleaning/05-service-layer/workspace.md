## Explore Agent Findings

### Agent 1: Find All Service Files
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

**Findings:**
- **Total Service Files:** 19
- **Total Exported Functions:** 127
- **Services with DTO Mapping:** 14/19 (74%)
- **Cross-service Dependencies:** 5 identified
- **Naming Convention Compliance:** 100% ‚úÖ

**File Distribution:**
- Largest: invoices.ts (18 functions, 1,084 lines)
- Smallest: quick-order.ts, maintenance.ts, numbering.ts (1 function each)

**Cross-Service Dependencies:**
- invoices.ts ‚Üí numbering, jobs, settings
- quotes.ts ‚Üí numbering, jobs, settings, invoices
- jobs.ts ‚Üí settings
- stripe.ts ‚Üí invoices
- quick-order.ts ‚Üí settings

**Files Found:** 19 services

### Agent 2: Analyze Service Patterns
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

**Findings:**
- **Overall Compliance:** 79.6%
- **Uses getServiceSupabase():** 19/19 (100%) ‚úÖ
- **Throws typed errors:** 19/19 (100%) ‚úÖ
- **Returns typed DTOs:** 18/19 (94.7%) ‚úÖ
- **JSDoc on functions:** 4/19 (21%) ‚ùå
- **Uses logger:** 14/19 (74%) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **No HTTP concerns:** 19/19 (100%) ‚úÖ
- **No auth logic (except auth service):** 17/19 (89%) ‚úÖ
- **Has business logic:** 19/19 (100%) ‚úÖ

**Critical Issues:**
1. **Schema parsing in services:** 12 services parse Zod schemas (should trust API validation)
   - clients.ts, invoices.ts, quotes.ts, materials.ts, printers.ts, product-templates.ts, and 6 more

2. **Missing JSDoc:** 15 services (79%) lack documentation
   - clients, exports, dashboard, jobs, numbering, printers, order-files, quick-order, etc.

3. **Missing logger:** 5 services don't log operations
   - exports.ts, dashboard.ts, numbering.ts, order-files.ts, tmp-files.ts

4. **Services too large:** 3 services exceed 800 lines
   - invoices.ts (1,084 lines) - Should split into invoices-core, invoices-payments, invoices-conversions
   - quotes.ts (835 lines) - Should split
   - jobs.ts (800 lines) - Should split into jobs-core, jobs-workflow, jobs-board

**Services Following All Patterns:** 2/19 (11%)
- auth.ts ‚úÖ
- messages.ts ‚úÖ

**Files Found:** 19 services analyzed

### Agent 3: Identify Business Logic in API Routes
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

**Findings:**
- **Total API Routes Analyzed:** 77
- **Routes with business logic to extract:** 24 routes
- **HIGH severity:** 7 routes (complex workflows)
- **MEDIUM severity:** 14 routes (calculations, rules)
- **LOW severity:** 3 routes (simple formatting)

**HIGH Severity Routes (Complex Workflows):**
1. `/quick-order/checkout/route.ts` - Multi-step invoice creation, file processing loop
2. `/quick-order/slice/route.ts` - Retry logic, fallback metrics, workflow coordination
3. `/auth/login/route.ts` - Multi-step auth workflow
4. `/auth/signup/route.ts` - Registration workflow
5. `/auth/change-password/route.ts` - Password change workflow
6. `/invoices/[id]/attachments/route.ts` - File upload with validation
7. `/quick-order/orient/route.ts` - File processing workflow

**MEDIUM Severity Routes (Business Rules):**
- Date calculations in jobs/route.ts
- Cookie expiration calculations in auth routes
- File validation in quick-order/upload
- Parameter parsing in dashboard, messages
- Role determination logic
- Authorization checks mixed with routing

**Recommended Service Functions to Create:**
1. Quick Order: `buildQuickOrderLines()`, `processQuickOrderFiles()`, `sliceQuickOrderFile()`
2. Auth: `calculateCookieExpiration()`, `buildAuthResponse()`, `validatePasswordChange()`
3. Utilities: `parsePaginationParams()`, `parseNumericId()`, `parseJobIds()`
4. Validators: `validateInvoiceAttachmentFile()`, `checkOrderFileAccess()`

**Files Found:** 24 routes need refactoring

## Implementation Strategy

Based on agent findings, Phase 5 has **3 major work streams**:

### Stream 1: Fix Service Layer Anti-Patterns (CRITICAL)
**Priority:** HIGH
**Impact:** 12 services

1. **Remove schema parsing from services**
   - Move `.parse()` calls from services to API routes
   - Services should receive typed objects (trust validation)
   - Affected: clients, invoices, quotes, materials, printers, product-templates, + 6 more

### Stream 2: Standardize Service Documentation & Logging
**Priority:** HIGH
**Impact:** 15 services (JSDoc), 5 services (Logger)

1. **Add JSDoc to all service functions**
   - Document parameters, return types, throws
   - Follow STANDARDS.md pattern

2. **Add logger to 5 services**
   - exports.ts, dashboard.ts, numbering.ts, order-files.ts, tmp-files.ts
   - Log important operations with scope

### Stream 3: Extract Business Logic from API Routes
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** 24 API routes

1. **Extract workflows from 7 HIGH severity routes**
   - Quick order checkout/slice/orient
   - Auth workflows
   - File upload workflows

2. **Extract business rules from 14 MEDIUM severity routes**
   - Calculations, validations, formatting
   - Create utility functions

## Notes & Observations

### Good News:
- All services use getServiceSupabase() correctly (100%)
- All services throw typed errors (100%)
- All services return DTOs (95%)
- No HTTP concerns in services (100%)
- Clean cross-service dependencies (no circular deps)

### Areas Needing Work:
- **Documentation gap:** 79% of services lack JSDoc
- **Validation anti-pattern:** 63% of services parse schemas (should be in API routes)
- **Logging gaps:** 26% of services don't use logger
- **Business logic in routes:** 31% of API routes contain logic that should be in services

### Phase 4 Impact:
- Phase 4 already moved all database access to services ‚úÖ
- This phase focuses on structure, documentation, and completing the separation of concerns
