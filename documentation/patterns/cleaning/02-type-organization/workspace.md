## Current Task

Beginning implementation - Creating type files in /lib/types/

## Explore Agent Findings

### Agent 1: Find All Type Definitions
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

**Findings:**
- 90+ type definitions scattered across codebase
- 15 locations where types are defined
- 12+ inline types not exported (hidden)
- 4+ duplicated types with separate implementations
- Types distributed across: schemas (15), services (15+), components (25+), utilities (8+)

**Files Found:** 90+ types in 15 locations

### Agent 2: Analyze Current Type Patterns
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

**Findings:**
- Current state: Partially organized (50/100)
- Good patterns: Schema-based inputs, enum constants, service-level DTOs
- Issues: Missing filter types, scattered component types, inconsistent DTO naming
- Anti-patterns: Inline filter objects, duplicate component types, mixed DTO naming
- Duplicates found: PrinterRecord vs PrinterDTO, ResolvedPaymentTerm in multiple files

**Files Found:** 75+ types analyzed

### Agent 3: Identify Type Dependencies
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

**Findings:**
- 254 total TypeScript/TSX files in codebase
- 95+ files importing types (37% of codebase)
- 72 files requiring import path updates
- ~63 import statements to update
- High-risk files: invoice-editor.tsx (3 imports), quote-editor.tsx (2 imports), invoices.ts (4+ imports)

**Files Found:** 72 files need updates

## Notes & Observations

- Phase 2 focuses on consolidating all types into `/lib/types/` directory
- Goal: Feature-colocated types following naming conventions (ResourceDTO, ResourceInput, ResourceFilters)
- Must follow Pattern 4 from STANDARDS.md

## Next Steps

- [ ] Deploy 3 Explore agents in parallel
- [ ] Analyze findings and create PLAN.md
- [ ] Create type files
- [ ] Update imports across codebase
